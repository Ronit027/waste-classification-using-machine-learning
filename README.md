# waste-classification-using-machine-learning
Waste Classifier is a Machine Learning project which is built using OpenCV, CVZone and Tensorflow python. The model is trained upon several data sets.  It identifies the type of waste using Computer Vision and predicts the type of bin it should be put in. In our case there is 4 types of bin Recyclable, Residual, Hazardous and Food Waste.
